# ReadMe Generator

  # Title

  ## Description
  
 I created this app so that you can easily create a readme fie by answering a series of questions. It will help expedite the process of creating one for each repo, site or app you build.
  
  ## Table of Contents (Optional)
  
  undefined
  
  - [Installation](#installation)
  - [Usage](#usage)
  - [Credits](#credits)
  - [License](#license)
  
  ## Installation
  
install inquirer package by typing npm i, then after it loads, type node index and then answer the questions.
  
  ## Usage
  
 This can be used by anyone to build their readmes, but will most likely be used by me for my own websites and apps

 Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

 
  ## Credits

  List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
  
  If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
  
  If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
  
  ## License
  MIT

  The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

  üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
  
  ## Badges

  Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
  
  ## Features
  javascript and node
  If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
  
  ## How to Contribute
  Let me know what questions should be removed or added to generate a good readme
  If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
  
  ## Tests
  
  Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
