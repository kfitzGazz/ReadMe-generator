 This will be used mostly by me, Kyleigh, on all my future projects to quickly generate README.md files. 

 Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

 
  ## Credits

  List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
  
  If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
  
  If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
  
  ## License

  The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

  Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
  
  ## Features
  key features include the javascript and command-line capabilities. 
  If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
  
  ## How to Contribute
  They can tell me what to eliminate in this series of questions, because it feels long to me.
  If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
  
  ## Tests
  
  Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
